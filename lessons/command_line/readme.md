# Instructor Notes

### command_line_lecture.md

This lecture is designed to introduce the students to the command line and
teach them how to maneuver between directories and do some basic file
manipulations. The goal is for this to be a "follow along" lecture. The
students and you will both have the Markdown as a reference, however this
works best if you are doing the same things they are and explaining common
pitfalls.

Also, sections written in the format:

> there is some question here

are designed as questions for you to ask the class, engage with them, and then
show them an answer.

The goal is that the students will know:

* cd
* cp
* rm
* mkdir
* stdout
* pipe
* echo
* curl

A few other techniques like grep are shown as well to give them a flavor for
the power of the command line. This also should prepare them for doing the
`git` lecture that follows.

### advanced_command_line

This content is included as a possible optional lecture later in the course,
but can be provided now so that more advanced students have access to it. You
should not lecture on it on day 1; but merely point out it exists.

It walks through things like bash scripting, sed, CRON jobs, etc.

### command_line_quick_reference.md

This is the extremely thorough breakdown of many command line techniques from
the beta curriculum. It is not suitable for an easy lecture, however it
contains lots of great information. I recommend telling the students that it
can act as a one-stop-shop for most of their command line questions. It also
includes many techniques we haven't mentioned during this lecture that might
be worth skimming through so they have an idea of some of the other commands
available to them. Do not lecture for this content.
