# Install software on your computer


### Install [git](http://git-scm.com/).

You have it installed if you can run `git --version` at the command
line and get output like `git version 2.13.5`.

Macbooks have git pre-installed.


### Install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads).

Please install the **3.x version** (or the most recent version).

There are two things you can verify to check your install.

First, from the command line, all of the following should start up
some kind of Python interpreter:

```bash
python3
ipython3
jupyter notebook
spyder
```

Second, inside any of those Python interpreters, you should be able to
do all of these without error:

```python
import numpy
import scipy
import matplotlib
import pandas
import statsmodels
import sklearn
```

### Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on Mac
